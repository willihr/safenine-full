# SafeNine

The following project aims to create and develop a bracelet that monitors a pregnant woman's vital signs, namely temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure. This information will be linked to an application also developed by us, in which it will be possible for the doctor to access it, establishing a connection that allows the professional to supervise and analyze the medical conditions of the pregnant woman from a distance, based on the data collected by the server.
The pink page is a simulation of the bracelet with the theoretically measured biological data, sending it to the server. The warnings that appear on the doctor's screen indicate alarming measures detected by the bracelet.
